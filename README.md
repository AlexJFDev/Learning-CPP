# learning-cpp
This Repo is for my work learning C++ in CSC 202

We are learning from [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/).

## Problems
Here are all the errors I found in the textbook
### [Chapter 10](https://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch10.html)
* Between "The following figure shows how vectors are represented in state diagrams:" and "The large numbers inside the boxes are the elements of the vector. The small numbers outside the boxes are the indices used to identify each box. When you allocate a new vector, the elements are not initialized. They could contain any values." the graphic is missing.
* In this sentence "No surprisingly, it returns the size of the vector (the number of elements)." "No surprisingly" should be "Unsurprisingly".
